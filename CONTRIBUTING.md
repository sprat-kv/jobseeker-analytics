---

### Set Up Environment Variables
_Estimated time: 3-5 minutes_
1. Copy `backend\.env.example` to `backend\.env`:
   ```sh
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```
2. Edit `backend/.env` to put in your own credentials, particularly 
   - Google OAuth Client ID goes in `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - Google AI API key goes in `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
   - Type a random string in `COOKIE_SECRET`

   **🔒 Never share your `.env` file or commit it to Git!**  
3. Copy `frontend\.env.sample` to `frontend\.env`:
   ```sh
   cp frontend/.env.sample frontend/.env
   ```
---


### Run the App: Two options
_Estimated time: 10-25 minutes_
#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Preferred Option) [⬆️ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1. If this is your first time using Docker, install as below:
   - Install Docker. On Windows/Mac install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). On Linux install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). 
   - Start Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
      - On Windows: make sure to select "Use the WSL 2 based engine" under Settings/general.
      - On Linux: you may need to take additional post-installation steps, see (here)[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/]. 
   - Make sure to verify your email address in the Account Settings.
2. Start the app using Docker compose-up. The first time you run this locally it may take a few minutes to set up.
```
docker-compose up --build
```
3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and click the **Login with Google** button. After you grant access it will go to work scanning your emails for relevant emails.
4. Troubleshooting:
   - Attempted import error
      - `cd frontend`
      - `npm ci`

You can view logs from the app by finding your container in Docker Desktop/Docker Engine and clicking on it. The app will automatically refresh when you make changes. 

#### Option 2: Virtual Environment [⬆️ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) 

Once your `.env` file is set up, start the app by following the instructions below:
1. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```sh
   # MAC/LINUX
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   ```sh
   # WINDOWS (CMD)
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```
3. Start the PostgreSQL database:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running.
   - Use Docker to start the PostgreSQL database:
     ```bash
     docker run --name jobseeker-db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=jobseeker_analytics -p 5433:5432 -d postgres:13
     ```
4. Run backend and frontend apps:
   In one terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   In another terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```
5. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and click the **Login with Google** button. After you grant access it will go to work scanning your emails for relevant emails.

### Inspect the Database with DBeaver [⬆️ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

To inspect your PostgreSQL database running in Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Install DBeaver**:
   - Go to the [DBeaver download page](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
   - Download and install the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Start Docker Services (choose one of the commands below to start it if you haven't already)**:
   - Ensure your Docker services are running using the following command:
     ```bash
     docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up --build
     ```
   - Or use the following command to simulate a production build (useful if you do not need to test frontend changes and only want to test backend functionality changes - you won't need to wait for the frontend to compile every time you navigate to a different page):
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

3. **Create a New Database Connection in DBeaver (if this is your first time opening DBeaver for this project)**:
   - Open DBeaver.
   - - Note: you may need to Download SQLLite driver files - Driver settings window will prompt you.
   - Click on the `Database` menu and select `New Database Connection`.
   - Select `PostgreSQL` and click `Next`.

4. **Enter Connection Details**:
   - **Host**: `localhost`
   - **Port**: `5433` (as specified in your `docker-compose.yaml` file)
   - **Database**: `jobseeker_analytics`
   - **Username**: `postgres`
   - **Password**: `postgres`
   - Click on the `Test Connection` button to ensure the connection is successful.
   - Note: you may need to Download PostgreSQL driver files - Driver settings window will prompt you.

5. **Save the Connection**:
   - If the connection test is successful, click `Finish` to save the connection.
   - If the connection test fails, double-check the connection details and ensure that your Docker services are running.

6. **Inspect the Database**:
   - In the `Database Navigator` pane on the left side of DBeaver, expand the `PostgreSQL` node.
   - Expand the `jobseeker_analytics` node to see the available schemas and tables.
   - Right-click on a table (e.g., `test_table`) and select `View Data` to see the data in the table.


### Troubleshooting Tips [⬆️ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
- **Not redirected after login?**  
  Double-check your `REDIRECT_URI` in both `.env` and Google Cloud settings.  
- **Invalid API key errors?**  
  Some Google APIs require API key restrictions—try generating a new unrestricted key for local testing.  
- **Cannot Build Docker Image?**
   Try option 2, with venv and FastAPI server instead. 

#### When do I need to rebuild Docker? 
- if you change `.env` variables, you'll need to `docker compose down` and `docker compose up --build`

### Submit Changes [⬆️ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)  
1. **Fork** this repository.  
2. **Clone** your fork:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jobseeker-analytics.git
   cd jobseeker-analytics
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
- use branch convention <feature|bugfix|hotfix|docs>/<issueNumber>-<issueDescription> e.g.
   ```sh
   git checkout -b docs/65-add-contribution-guidelines
   ```
4. **Make your changes** and commit them:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add submission guidelines and env setup"
   ```
   Note: if you end up using a new Python library (e.g. I just added `ruff`) with `pip install`, be sure to do the following from the `backend` folder:
   `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

   You will need to add the `requirements.txt` file change as a commit, to ensure the environment has all its dependencies and production and local development environments run smoothly.
   ```sh
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "add python library ruff"
   ```

5. **Format your changes** and commit them:

- If you're using Python, run:
   ```sh
   ruff format path/to/your/code
   git add .
   git commit -m "format with ruff"
   ```
(Please ensure your code passes all linting checks before submitting a pull request.)

6. **Push to your fork**:  
   ```sh
   git push origin docs/65-add-contribution-guidelines
   ```
7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub. See tips below. Credit to Taro ([warning: you will make me money if you sign up through this link](https://www.jointaro.com/r/liannan073/))

**Keeping Your Local Copy Up to Date**

After your feature has been accepted and merged, it's important to ensure your local copy is up to date before starting any new work. Especially if you're about to begin work on a different feature, follow these steps:
```sh
git checkout main             # Switch back to the main branch
git pull                      # Update your local copy with the latest changes
git checkout -b new_branch_name  # Create a new branch for your next feature
```
This ensures you're always working on the latest version of the codebase.

### Pull Request Methodology

#### 1. The "One Diff, One Thesis" Principle

- Each code change should focus on a single purpose or goal.

**What This Means:**
- Make each pull request about one specific improvement
- Address one feature, bug fix, or enhancement at a time
- Keep your changes focused and related to one objective

**Why It Matters:**
When your changes have a single purpose, they're easier to review, understand, and test. If something goes wrong, it's also easier to identify and fix the problem.

**Example:**
If you're working on a user profile page:
- ✅ GOOD PR: Add email validation to the registration form
- ❌ BAD PR: Add email validation, redesign the profile layout, and optimize database queries

Think of each PR as a single chapter in a book, not the entire story.

#### 2. Keep Pull Requests Under 250 Lines of Code

Smaller code changes are easier to review and less likely to introduce bugs.

**How to Stay Under the Limit:**
- Count only meaningful lines of code you've added or changed
- Break large features into a series of smaller, sequential changes
- Submit related changes in separate pull requests

**Breaking Down Large Features:**
When implementing something complex, try this approach:
1. First PR: Set up the basic structure
2. Second PR: Implement core functionality
3. Third PR: Add refinements and advanced features

**Example:**
Instead of one massive PR for a new search feature, create:
1. PR #1: Add search box to navigation
2. PR #2: Connect search box to backend
3. PR #3: Implement search results display
4. PR #4: Add filtering options

#### 3. Make Your Code Testable

Always include a way to verify your changes work correctly.

**Verification Methods:**
- **Automated tests:** Write code that checks your changes automatically
- **Screenshots/Videos:** For visual changes, show before and after
- **Test instructions:** Provide clear steps for others to test your changes

**What Good Testing Looks Like:**
- Tests cover both expected behavior and edge cases
- Instructions are specific enough that anyone could follow them
- Visual evidence clearly demonstrates the improvement

**Example:**
For a login form improvement:
```
Test Plan:
1. Try logging in with a correct username/password → Should succeed
2. Try logging in with an incorrect password → Should show error message
3. Try logging in with a blank password → Should prevent submission

[Screenshots attached showing each scenario]
```

Remember: Good pull requests aren't just about the code you write—they're about making changes that others can understand, verify, and maintain.

Lastly, do your best to follow the below coding style guides.
- Python: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
- TypeScript: https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html
- HTML/CSS: https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html
