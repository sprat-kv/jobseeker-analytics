            Hi @{{assignee}}! I'm checking in on issue "{{issue_title}}".
            I completely understand that volunteer projects like this are not a priority,
            and I certainly don't want to add any unnecessary stress or make you feel forced to volunteer.

            We haven't seen any updates in this GitHub issue. Sometimes folks aren't sure what kind of update to provide,
            so even something simple like these examples would be great:

            - "Haven't had a chance to start this yet, but I'm still interested and plan to look at it by [specific date]."
            - "I've done some initial research into [mention specific area, e.g., 'the API documentation'], but haven't written code yet."
            - "I've started on this locally and hope to push a draft PR soon, even if it's just a few lines."

            As the maintainer for this project, I'm just trying to keep us both accountable and make sure you're still interested in moving forward with this task.
            
            If I don't see any activity on this issue (even a quick comment saying you're planning on working on it)
            in the next {{days_remaining}} days, I'll unassign you from the issue.
            
            This isn't meant to pressure you, but rather to ensure the task keeps moving forward and to give someone else the opportunity if your focus has shifted.

            Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to support you.
