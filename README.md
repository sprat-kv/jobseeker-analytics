## **About Just A Job App (JAJA)**

**JAJA is an email analytics tool for the 30% of jobseekers exhausted by rejections..** 

Built for the data-driven job seeker who dreams of a r/DataIsBeautiful post but can't face the emotional toll of updating a spreadsheet with every rejection.

- Just a Job App is open source. Fork it, remix it, or carry it on if I ever disappear to open a cat café. 🐾
- FYI, our sustainability model is still evolving. The goal is to keep it free for jobseekers, forever.
- Later on, we may introduce an enterprise offering to support that mission.
