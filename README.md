## **About Just A Job App (JAJA)**

**JAJA tracks your job applications automatically, no spreadsheet required.** 

Isn't tracking companies you've applied to exhausting? The emotional toll burned me out faster than the job hunt itself.

That's why I built JAJA—
to automate the tedious work of tracking applications.

- Just a Job App is open source. Fork it, remix it, or carry it on if I ever disappear to open a cat café. 🐾
- FYI, our sustainability model is still evolving. The goal is to keep it free for jobseekers, forever.
- Later on, we may introduce an enterprise offering to support that mission.
