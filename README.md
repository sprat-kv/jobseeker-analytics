## **About Just a Job App**

Built by jobseekers, for jobseekers. Free forever.

Tired of abandoned spreadsheets and forgotten Notion tables?

Just a Job App tracks your job applications — automatically, straight from your inbox.

No manual tracking. No extra tabs. Just a simpler job search.

## 📢 **A note from the maintainer**

- Just a Job App is open source. Fork it, remix it, or carry it on if I ever disappear to open a cat café. 🐾
- FYI, our sustainability model is still evolving. The goal is to keep it free for jobseekers, forever.
- Later on, we may introduce an enterprise offering to support that mission.
