# **jobba.help - The Open-Source Job Search Tracker**

## **Overview**

jobba.help is an open-source job tracker that reliably logs every application by integrating with your inbox—no manual entry, just automated and accurate tracking.

## **The Vision**

With enough support, jobba.help will overhaul the job search. The more jobseekers contribute, the better insights and tools we generate. 

Imagine the perfect job search:

- **Relevant roles**  - you don't have to visit 10 job boards to find a job
- **Analytics** - you know which industries and company sizes your profile attracts
- **Task organization** - see pending interviews and follow-ups at a glance without digging through hundreds of emails
- **Ghosting exposed** - public leaderboards will discourage bad hiring practices
- **Interview scheduling** is effortless, eliminating back-and-forth emails
- **Asking for help is easy** - Share job search updates with your support system and keep your search visible to the people who can vouch for you

## **Want to sign up?**

We've currently reached our capacity for beta users and aren't officially accepting new sign-ups at this time, which means you won't be able to use our hosted website.

**You have two options:**

1. **Join the waitlist** to receive updates when we launch outside of beta: https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/1348245/149432531062621442/share
2. **Use the app right away on your personal computer**: This means downloading our code and installing the app directly on your computer instead of using our website. Don't worry if you're not technical - this is actually a great learning opportunity, and we're here to help!

If you choose option 2, I'd be happy to walk you through the process step-by-step. 
- This gives you full access to all features while we work on publishing the app outside of beta.
- Feel free to email help@jobba.help for personalized assistance with setting up the app on your computer. 
- For those familiar with GitHub, the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lnovitz/jobseeker-analytics/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in our repository also contains setup instructions.

## **Latest Feature: Automated Job Tracker**

Our automated job tracker allows you to:

- **Login with Google:** Automatically generate a spreadsheet filled with the date you applied, company name, and status of the application.
- **No manual updates required:** The spreadsheet updates automagically, saving you time and effort.

## 📢 **A note from the maintainer**

Help us build the first open-source job search platform. Join our Discord at [https://discord.gg/5tTT6WVQyw](https://discord.gg/5tTT6WVQyw)

Why open-source, you might ask?

Companies often prioritize their own interests over those of jobseekers, focusing on profit rather than genuine support.

My goal is different.

I envision a community-driven tool, built by the people, for the people, ensuring it remains accessible and beneficial to all jobseekers.

Because it's open-source, future developers can always fork this project and continue the work. 

This is especially important if I, the maintainer, ever win the lottery, retire my computer, and open a cat café. 👀
