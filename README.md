## **Stop wasting time filling out spreadsheets**

**Option 1: Waitlist**

Our beta is full :( **[Join the waitlist](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/1348245/149432531062621442/share)** to receive updates when we launch outside of beta.

**Option 2: Clone**

**Use the app right away on your personal computer**:
   - This means downloading our code and installing the app directly on your computer instead of using our website.

If you choose option 2, do the following:

## 📢 **A note from the maintainer**
