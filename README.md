*As a job seeker with a gmail account, I want to be able to calculate  my initial application  response rate with the touch of a button*

## Example

Below is an example of a typical email you'd receive after applying for a role.

> From: noreply-hr@flyingunicornsarefake.com
>
> Date: January 1
> 
> Subject: We received your application
> 
> Body: Thanks for applying to FlyingUnicorns! We'll reach out if there's a fit.


<details>
<summary>Let's imagine I sent a total of 10 applications on January 1, including the 1 above for FlyingUnicorns.
</summary>

> From: noreply-hr@company1isfake.com

Now let's imagine on January 14, 2 weeks later, the only response I've gotten is from the FlyingUnicorns company.

<br>

>
>
> From: noreply-hr@flyingunicornsarefake.com
>
> Date: January 14
> 
> Subject: Update from FlyingUnicorns
> 
> Body: In your application we noticed you said you live in outer space. We only hire on Earth, sorry! We'll keep in touch if our borders open up though.

While that's a response, it's not the response we're looking for. 
<br>So we're batting 0% response rate so far.

But wait, there's hope!

On January 28, Company 6 responded.
> From: fakeperson@company6isfake.com
>
> Date: January 28
> 
> Subject: Interview Availability for Company 6
> 
> Body: Thanks for applying to Company 6! We'd like to schedule a short call to discuss the engineering role you applied for.

So at this point, our response rate is `10%` 

But most people are not simply sending 10 applications and tracking their numbers, at least not these days. You might be casting a wide net, sending hundreds of applications and not bothering to check on your response rate. 10% is a great response rate. But what if your response rate was only 1%? That's an indicator that your resume needs changing. 

## Thoughts for Later Iterations

Imagine if you could check your response rates against different industries... you could make your job search more targeted and effective. 

Imagine if you had a tool to save the resume you used when applying for roles - and could check the response rates against the resume version you used against a specific industry.

Imagine if you could track your success rates with referrals, or you could see at what stage you're getting stuck.
